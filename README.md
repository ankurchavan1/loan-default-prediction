# Loan Default Prediction Model

In this project, I have created a loan default prediction model using three different algorithms - Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree. After testing these models on the dataset, I found that Random Forest is the most accurate model with an accuracy of 85.19%.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a model that can predict whether a loan applicant will default or not. 

## Dependencies

- Python 
- pandas 
- scikit-learn 
- matplotlib 
- seaborn 

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Before building the loan default prediction model, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset to gain insights into the data and identify any patterns or trends. The EDA involved plotting various graphs and charts to visualize the data and study the relationships between different variables.

## Model Building and Evaluation

After performing EDA, I used three different algorithms - Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree - to build the loan default prediction model. I trained each of these models on the dataset and evaluated their performance using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms to predict loan default. By comparing the performance of different algorithms, it was found that Random Forest is the most accurate model. This project provides a good starting point for those interested in machine learning and predictive modeling.
